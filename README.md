## üóÇ Contents
I uploaded this repository as Optimal Control coursework for KAIST.
This repo contains some exercise solutions for Daniel Liberzon's _Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control Theory: A Concise Introduction_ book and other problems.

## üìú Exercise List
Here is the list of exercises divided by lectures, so they can be more easily searched. Equations are left in Latex and will be hopefully displayed by Github in the future.

- [Lecture 2](#lecture-2): _Calculus of variations_: examples of variational problems; Euler-Lagrange equation; Hamiltonial formalism and Legendre
transformation; mechanical interpretation; constraints; second variation and Legendre‚Äôs necessary condition; weak and strong extrema; conjugate points and sufficient conditions
- [Lecture 3](#lecture-3): _From Calculus of Variations to Optimal Control_ : statement of the optimal control problem; variational argument and preview of the maximum principle
- [Lecture 4](#lecture-4): _The Maximum Principle_: statement and proof of the maximum principle; relation to Lie brackets; bang-bang and singular optimal
controls; dynamic programming; sufficient conditions for optimality
- [Lecture 5](#lecture-5): _The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation_: HJB equations; viscosity solutions of the HJB equation
