*Prove the two following propositions.*\

differentiable) function and $x^*$ is its local minimum. Then,
$$\langle \nabla f (x^*), d  \rangle \geq 0$$ for all feasible
directions $d$.\
**Proposition 2 (Second-order necessary condition for constrained
optimality):** Suppose that $f$ is a $\mathcal{C}^2$ (continuously
differentiable) function and $x^*$ is its local minimum. Then,

that $$\langle \nabla f (x^*), d \rangle = 0$$\

-------------

*Solve the problem*

$$\begin{aligned}
    &u^* := \argmin_{u:[0,t_f] \to [-1, 1]} J := t_f \\
    &\text{subject to} \\
    &\begin{cases}
        &\Dot{x}_1(t) = -4 x_1(t) + 2x_2(t) + 2u(t)\\
        &\Dot{x}_2(t) = 3x_1(t) -3x_2(t)
    \end{cases}
    \smallspace
    \begin{cases}
        &x_1(0) = x_0 \smallspace x_2(0) = 0 \\
        &x_1(t_f) = 0, \smallspace x_2(t_f) = 0
    \end{cases}\end{aligned}$$\


Exercise 4.11 (Linear-quadratic problem)
----------------------------------------

*Solve the problem*

$$\begin{aligned}
    &u^* := \argmin_{u:[0,T] \to \mathbb{R}} J(u) := \frac{1}{2}q \cdot x(T)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^T u(t) ^2 dt \\
    &\text{subject to}\\
    &\Dot{x}(t) = ax(t) + bu(t), \smallspace x(0) = x_0\end{aligned}$$

*where a, b are given nonzero scalars, $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ is an
initial state, $T > 0$ is a fixed final time, and $q > 0$ is a given
positive scalar.*\

Exercise 4.12 (Control of production and consumption)
-----------------------------------------------------

*Suppose we own a factory whose output we can control. Let us begin to
construct a mathematical model by setting*

1.  *$x(t)$: amount of output produced at time $t \in [0,T]$*

2.  *$u(t)$: fraction of output reinvested at time $t \in [0,T]$*

*This will be our control, and is subject to the obvious constrain that*
$$u(t) \in [0,1]$$

*Given such a control, the corresponding dynamics are provided by the
ODE*

$$\begin{aligned}
    &\Dot{x}(t) = ku(t)x(t) \\
    &x(0) = x_0\end{aligned}$$

*where the constant $k >0$ modeling the growth rate of our reinvestment
and $u(t)x(t)$ is the amount of reinvested output. Let us take as a
payoff functional*

$$J(u) = \int_0^T (1 - u(t))x(t)dt$$

*where $(1-u(t))x(t)$ is our consumption. The meaning is that we want to
maximize our total consumption of the output.*\
*The overall problem is:* $$\begin{aligned}
    &u^* := \argmax_{u:[0,T] \to [0,1]} J(u) = \int_0^T (1-u(t))x(t)dt \\

Exercise 4.13
-------------

*A young investor has earned in the stock market a large amount of money
S and plans to spend it so as to maximize his enjoyment through the rest
of his life without working. He estimates that he will live exactly T
more years and that his capital $x(t)$ should be reduced to zero at time
T, i.e., $x(T) = 0$. Also he models the evolution of his capital by the
differential equation*

$$\Dot{x}(t) = \alpha x(t) - u(t)$$

*where $x(0) = S$ is his initial capital, $\alpha > 0$ is a given
interest rate, and $u(t) \geq 0$ is his rate of expenditure. The total
enjoyment he will obtain is given by*
$$\int_0^T e^{-\beta t} \sqrt{u(t)}dt$$

*Here $\beta$ is some positive scalar, which serves to discount the
future enjoyment. Find the optimal control $u^* (t), t \in [0, T]$.*\

*Solve the problem* $$\begin{aligned}
    &u^* := \argmin_{u:[0,T] \to \mathbb{R}} J(u) = \int_0^T \sqrt{1 + u(t)^2}dt \\
    &\text{subject to}\\
    &\Dot{x}(t) = u(t), \smallspace x(0)=x_0\end{aligned}$$ *where

*Solve the problem* $$\begin{aligned}
    &u^* := \argmin_{u:[0,T] \to \mathbb{R}} J(u) = \int_0^T \sqrt{1 + u(t)^2}dt \\
    &\text{subject to}\\
    &\Dot{x}(t) = u(t), \smallspace x(0)=x_0\end{aligned}$$ *where
$x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ is an initial state, $T>0$ is a fixed final time.*\

-------------

    &u^* := \argmin_{u:[0,T] \to \mathbb{R}} J(u) = \int_0^T \sqrt{1 + u(t)^2}dt \\
    &\text{subject to}\\
    &\Dot{x}(t) = u(t), \smallspace x(0)=x_0, \smallspace x(T) = x_1\end{aligned}$$
*where $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ is an initial state, $T>0$ is a fixed final
time.*\

------------

*Complete the proof of the principle of optimality by showing the
reverse inequality $V(t,x) \leq \Bar{V}(t,x)$.*\

Exercise 5.15 (Linear quadratic optimal tracking)
-------------------------------------------------

*For completeness, we consider a slightly more general form of the
linear quadratic regulator. The standard LQR derivation attempts to
drive the system to zero. Consider now the problem:*

$$\begin{aligned}
    &u^* := \argmin_{u:[0,T] \to \mathbb{R}^m} J(u) \\
    &\text{subject to}\\
    &\Dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), \smallspace x(0)=x_0\end{aligned}$$
*where* $$\begin{split}
        J(u) := &(x(T) - x_d (T)) ^T Q_f (x(T) - x_d (T) )  \\ 
        + &\int_0^T \left( (x(t) - x_d(t)) ^T Q(x(t) - x_d(t)) + (u(t) - u_d(t)) ^T R(u(t) - u_d(t)) \right) dt
    \end{split}$$

*$Q_f = Q_f^T \geq 0$ (positive semidefinite), $Q = Q^T \geq 0$
(positive semidefinite), $R = R^T >0$ (positive definite).*\
*Find a formulation of an optimal policy and the corresponding HJB
equation (similar to the Riccati equation) using the sufficient
condition.*\
*Hint: consider a candidate of value functions of the following form*
$$\hat{V}(x,t) = x^T S_2(t) x + s_1^T(t) x + s_0(t), \smallspace S_2(t) = S_2(t) ^T >0, \smallspace s_1(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n, \smallspace s_0(t) \in \mathbb{R}.$$\

equation.*\

solution that is quadratic in x.*\

Exercise 5.19 (Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem)
--------------------------------------------------------

*Consider a cart with an inverted pendulum hinged on top of it. For simplicity, the cart and the pendulum are
assumed to move in only one plane, and the friction, the mass of the
stick, and the gust of wind are disregarded. The problem is to maintain
the pendulum at the vertical position. For example, if the inverted
pendulum is falling in the direction shown, the cart moves to the right
and exerts a force, through the hinge, to push the pendulum back to the
vertical position.*\
*Let's consider the linearized inverted pendulum system (assuming
$\theta(t)$ and $\Dot{\theta}(t)$ are very small)*

$$\begin{bmatrix}
    \Dot{x}_1(t) \\ \Dot{x}_3(t) \\ \Dot{x}_3(t) \\  \Dot{x}_4(t) \\ 
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -\frac{mg}{M} & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & \frac{(M+m)g}{Ml} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_1(t) \\ x_2(t) \\ x_3(t) \\ x_4(t)
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\ \frac{1}{M} \\ 0 \\ - \frac{1}{Ml}
\end{bmatrix}
u(t)$$ *where
$x_1(t) = x(t), \smallspace x_2(t) = \Dot{x}(t), \smallspace x_3(t) = \theta(t), \smallspace and \smallspace x_4(t) = \Dot{\theta}(t)$.*\
*Consider the LQR problem*

$$\begin{aligned}
    &u^* := \argmin_{u:[0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}^m} J(u) := \int_0^\infty \left( x(t)^T Qx(t) + u(t)^T R u(t) \right) dt \\
    &\text{subject to}\\
    &\Dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), \smallspace x(0) = x_0\end{aligned}$$

*where A and B are appropriate system matrices with m=1, M=2, l=3 and
g=9.8.*\
*Tasks:*

1.  *Appropriately choose the weighting $Q \geq 0$ and $R > 0$ to
    maintain the pendulum at the vertical position, i.e.,
    $\theta(t) = 0$ and $\Dot{\theta}(t) = 0$ as much as possible.*

2.  *Find an optimal policy for the LQR problem using Python or Matlab
    functions.*

3.  *Plot trajectories of the system x(t) and the control input u(t)
    over certain time interval to demonstrate the performance of your
    optimal control policy.*

4.  *In the answer, please include your Python or Matlab codes.*

5.  *Change the weight and see how the performance changes and discuss
    about the results.*

*Consider the double integrator* $$\begin{aligned}
    &\Dot{x}_1(t) = x_2(t), \\
    &\Dot{x}_2(t) = u(t)\end{aligned}$$ *and the cost*
$$J(u) = \int_{t_0}^\infty \left( x_1(t)^2 + x_2(t)^2 + u(t) ^2 \right) dt$$
*Find P by solving the ARE. Verify (either analytically or numerically)
that it is indeed the steady-state solution of the RDE.*\



Exercise 6.24
-------------

*Consider the infinite-horizon LQR problem* $$\begin{aligned}
    &u^* := \argmin_{u:[0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}} J(u) := \int_0^\infty \left( qx(t)^2 + ru(t)^2  \right) dt \\
    &\text{subject to}\\
    &\Dot{x}(t) = ax(t) + bu(t), \smallspace t \in [t_0, \infty) \\
    &x(t_0) = x_0\end{aligned}$$

*where $a, q, r > 0$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$ is arbitrary. Find the
optimal control law. Moreover, show that for $r \to 0$, the eigenvalue
of the optimal closed-loop system moves off to $- \infty$, while for
$r \to \infty$, the eigenvalue of the optimal closed-loop system tends
to $‚àía$*\


Exercise 6.25 (Boeing 747 Lateral Model)
-------------

*The complete lateral model of a Boeing 747 is* $$\begin{aligned}
    &\Dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\
    &y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)\end{aligned}$$ *where* $$A = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -10 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0.0729 & -0.0558 & -0.997 & 0.0802 & 0.0415 & 0 \\
        -4.75 & 0.598 & -0.115 & -0.0318 & 0 & 0 \\

        0 & 0 & 0.0805 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -0.3333 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    , \smallspace B =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0\\
    \end{bmatrix}$$ *and* $$C =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -0.3333
    \end{bmatrix}
    , \smallspace D=0$$

*Minimize the sum of the energy of the output y and the energy of the
control u. The main effort is to minimize the energy of y which is
supposed to be zero in a steady state condition. So we put a weight
$q = 9.527 > 1$ on the energy of y. The problem now is as follows.*

$$\begin{aligned}
    &u^* := \argmin_{u:[0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}} J(u) := \int_0^\infty [qy(t)^Ty(t) + u(t)^2] dt \\

    Python or Matlab functions.*

2.  *Plot trajectories of $y(t)$ and $u(t)$.*

3.  *In the answer, please include your Python or Matlab codes.*
